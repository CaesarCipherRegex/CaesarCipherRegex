ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CaesarCipherRegex, when I started Google was 3 years old !
I am here, in Github, to stay in the train...ðŸ˜‰
-------------------
Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion in stock.
In 2019 Github started to block the access of some countries, Cuba, Syria, Iran.
That's the new free world, that's open source and under control...
